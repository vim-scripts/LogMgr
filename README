Log Mgr is a very simple script to tail logs while editing files. It does the following:

1. Sources a global variable to create key bindings to log files
2. A user can use the key bindings to see a buffer of the log
3. The user can refresh this buffer

More complex versions are planned for the future, until then any suggestions are welcome
